# FIKA Network

Is it awkward to reach out to people on LinkedIn? Then FIKA Network is made for you! It will match you with your perfect mentor allowing you to gain valuable insight into your field of interest.

## Inspiration
As undergraduate students in Canada who have been seeking for an internship, we were told numerous times about the importance of networking, and one of the best platforms to do so is LinkedIn. However, it is much easier said than done. How do we cold-message people who are already seniors in the field? How should we present ourselves so that we don't seem over-the-top? How do we know if the person really wants to talk to us, or they simply reply out of politeness? How do we ask a professional for a coffee-chat and ensure they don't feel that their time is wasted? Tons of questions and FIKA is here to help!

## How it works
The app works like a dating app, where you either login through your LinkedIn credentials, or sign-up for an account. Then, you will be prompted to enter some basic personal information, e.g. age, gender, interested positions/field. These information will be used in a matching algorithm to find the best mentor for you! The matching also takes place for the mentors, so they are also given the option to choose their potential mentees. Once you are matched, you can confidently start messaging your mentor, knowing that they are willing to help you out!
